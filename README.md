# MicroserviceOnServicefabric

### An Owin/katana selfhost REST API (products crud with webapi and EF codefirst) as stateless microservice on a Servicefabric cluster

This is a demonstration of implementing a microservice managing crud operations for a product entity added on a Servicefabric cluster.

#### I havent done a live demonstration on this since there is no free plan on azure and I run servicefabric on a local cluster but the productSrvc as a REST api can be found deployed here http://owinrestproductsapi.azurewebsites.net/swagger/ui/index#/Products
